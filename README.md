JARV-X is a fully offline, voice-controlled AI assistant built with Python.  
It uses speech recognition, text-to-speech, and local LLMs via Ollama to deliver fast, private, and internet-free AI interactions.

Designed for students, developers, and hackers who want a Jarvis-style assistant running entirely on their own machine.
